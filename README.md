Install these dependencies before running the app

- npm install --save firebase 
- npm install --save firebase-admin
- npm install react-native-elements
- npm install react-native-maps
- npm install react-native-maps-directions

For testing, you can use
email: c@gmail.com (for the customer)
email: r@gmail.com (for the restaurant)
password: 123123 (for both accounts)

You can register an email and password and use those credentials to log in. The credentials are written to the firebase database also.
