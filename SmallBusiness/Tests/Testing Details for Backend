For testing backend, we are using jest, chai, and puppeteer

Here are the dependencies:
Jest:
-npm install --save-dev jest

chai:
npm install chai

pupeteer:
npm install --save-dev puppeteer

Currently, tests are still a work in progress and just need to written clearly. The tests currently in this folder will fail...because I'm still getting familiar with ReactJS. 

I'll leave testing updates here
